#how to install a software 

Advance Package Tool (APT) is an advance interface to install package/software easily via Command line from software repositories of ubuntu.
We use this tool with a command => apt-get
its 4 basic functions are:
1. Install
e.g => sudo apt-get install packagename #install package
2. Remove
e.g => sudo apt-get remove packagename #remove package
3. Update
e.g => sudo apt-get update #update repositories
4. Upgrade
e.g => sudo apt-get upgrade #upgrade install packages 

Apt stores a list of repositories or software channels in the file => /etc/apt/sources.list
