#There are two types of users
1. root (who can do everything) also known as Super User
2. normal user (who has access only to his home directory and all the directory under it)

To accomplish task outside our home directory like creating files, directories and links and installing softwares etc we need super user privileges.
There are two types of doing this:
1.To become a root we use a command:
sudo su => means super user do super user
to end this session we use:
exit

2.To use super user power/controls/privileges. 
To use this method we need to add => sudo  
before every command

**super user is denoted by # sign on command line
