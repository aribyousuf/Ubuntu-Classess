Cron stands for Command Run ON. It is a mechanism that allows you to tell the system to run certain commands at certain times. 
So for instance, I could craft a script to check how much space is left on the disk that holds the home directories and send an email to 
certain people if the free disk space gets below a certain amount. Then I would use cron to get this script to run automatically every hour.

Cron allows a fair bit of control in terms of when commands are scheduled to run. Like most things in Linux, 
it is managed by way of a text file. The layout of the text file can be a little daunting but once you get the hang of it it's not that bad. 
There are many websites out there with good references to make it easy as well.

The file that manages cron is called a crontab. Each user may have their own crontab and within 
it each line represents a schedule for a particular command as follows:

* * * * * command to execute

Where the *'s represent (in order from left to right:

Minutes (0 - 59)
Hours (0 - 23)
Day of Month (1 - 31)
Months (1 - 12)
Day of week (0 - 7) (0 and 7 are Sunday)
A * in any of those places means every one of those increments.

Some examples:

* * * * * /bin/myscript.sh

Execute myscript.sh every minute.

30 3 * * 4 /bin/myscript.sh

Execute myscript.sh every Thursday at 3:30am.

To view a list of what tasks you currently have scheduled you may run the following command:

crontab -l

To edit your scheduled tasks, run the following command. It will open up in your default text editor which is normally Vim.

crontab -e

To remove your schedules tasks:

cron -r
